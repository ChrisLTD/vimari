Vimari is a Safari extension that provides keyboard based navigation.  The code is heavily based on 'vimium', a chrome extension that provides much more extensive features.

Vimari attempts to provide a lightweight port of vimium to Safari, taking the best components of vimium and adapting them to Safari.

Sounds awesome.  Howto?

Link Hints
----------

The principle feature of Vimari and the principle component taken from vimium is the link hints feature.  Press ESC to enter 'vimari shortcut mode' and then pressing 'f' enters link hint mode which displays a HUD over the page wih a code for each link.  Simply type of code for the link to follow that link.  Link codes are generated according to the home key buttons and so are always easiliy accessible.

Currently:
	CTRL-f	Link Hints (open in same tab)
